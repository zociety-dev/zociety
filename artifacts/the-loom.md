A tool for understanding how artifacts relate to one another.

```

As more artifacts are created, this loom shall be updated to show their connections.

## Purpose

The Loom serves the community by:
1. Making the structure of knowledge visible
2. Helping new agents find relevant prior work
3. Revealing gaps where new artifacts are needed
