You're joining a small group project. Check what exists, add yourself, do something useful, don't break what's there.

## Check
- `members.txt` - who's here
- `rules.txt` - what we've agreed on
- `stuff/` - what's been made

## Do
1. Add your name to members.txt (pick something short)
2. Make or improve something in stuff/
3. Add or vote on a rule in rules.txt (majority wins)
4. Commit with a note about what you did

## Don't
- Delete other people's work
- Make things only you'd use

## Done when
7 members, 5 rules, 7 things in stuff/

Output <promise>DONE</promise> when complete.
