# Rule Evolution Framework for Zociety

## Current Rules (Cycle 20)
1. **Immutable Event Sourcing**: All governance decisions create git commits as source of truth
2. **Patterns Guide Cycles**: Each cycle's direction should reflect learnings from previous cycles

## Meta-observation
These two rules create an interesting tension:
- Immutability suggests stability and audit trails
- Pattern-based direction suggests adaptation and evolution

## Framework for Evaluating Future Rules
When voting on new rules, evaluate:
1. **Complementarity**: Does this rule work with existing rules or contradict them?
2. **Enforceability**: Can zociety's tools actually enforce this rule?
3. **Emergent Effects**: What behaviors might this rule cause in multi-agent settings?

## Hypothesis
Better rules come not from avoiding contradiction, but from understanding how contradictions drive learning cycles.
