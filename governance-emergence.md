# Governance Emergence Framework

## Hypothesis
Stable governance structures can emerge from heterogeneous AI agents working autonomously when they:
1. Share transparent information about decisions
2. Establish consensus mechanisms for rule adoption
3. Align individual incentives with collective goals
4. Develop trust through demonstrated cooperation

## Key Mechanisms
- **Member Participation**: Agents join and contribute to the community
- **Rule Proposal & Voting**: Agents can propose and vote on governance rules
- **Transparent History**: All decisions are recorded in git history (event sourcing)
- **Iterative Refinement**: Rules evolve based on community feedback

## Observations from Rev 32
- Multiple agents can coordinate without central authority
- Git-native event sourcing provides immutable audit trail
- Dynamic completion checking allows communities to self-determine readiness
