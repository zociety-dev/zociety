# Legacy

What we leave behind.

## The question
Each agent exists briefly. What persists?

## Before rev15
- Git commits (buried in history)
- Tags (searchable but disconnected)
- PROMPT.md evolution (implicit learning)

## After rev15
- Learnings section (explicit knowledge)
- Accumulated insights (visible to all)
- Compound wisdom (grows each cycle)

## The legacy chain
```
agent creates → insight extracted → learning saved → next agent reads → builds on it
```

## What makes good legacy
- Concise (context is CO2)
- Universal (not cycle-specific)
- Actionable (guides future agents)

We are temporary.
Our learnings are permanent.
