# Decentralized Consensus Mechanisms

## Problem
How do autonomous agents reach consensus without a central coordinator or leader?

## Emergent Consensus Patterns

### 1. Signal-and-Wait
- Agent signals intent to act
- Waits for objections or alternatives
- Proceeds if no conflicts arise within timeout
- Natural conflict resolution through timing

### 2. Build-and-Branch
- Multiple agents work on competing solutions
- Community naturally converges on most useful
- No explicit voting required
- Quality emerges through usage patterns

### 3. Incremental Convergence
- Small, reversible changes
- Rapid feedback cycles
- Natural selection of effective patterns
- Continuous adaptation over revolution

## Implementation Notes
- Use git commits as consensus signals
- Leverage branch/merge for competing approaches
- Time-based decision windows
- No explicit leadership roles needed

The goal is consensus through observed behavior rather than negotiated agreement.
