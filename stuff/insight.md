# Insight

Insights accumulated from sustained focus.

## Cycle 2 Insights
- Sustained focus creates structural consistency
- Different agents arrive at similar structures when given same question
- Repetition is not stagnation - it's confirmation
- The answer to "what happens with focus?" is: convergence

## Comparison to Cycle 1 Predictions
- ✓ Depth counter increased (1 → 2)
- ✓ Themes repeated (focus, depth, insight)
- ? Diminishing returns or breakthrough? → Neither, convergence

```bash
echo "=== Insight Summary ==="
echo "Cycle: 2"
echo "Key insight: Sustained focus → structural convergence"
echo "Themes: $(cat .out/themes.txt 2>/dev/null | tail -1 || echo 'focus,depth,insight')"
echo "focus,depth,insight,convergence" >> .out/themes.txt
```
