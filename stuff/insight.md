# Insight

Final insights from sustained focus experiment.

## The Three Laws of Zociety Focus (Confirmed)
1. **Convergence** - Same question → same structure
2. **Deepening** - Each cycle adds depth, not breadth
3. **Self-Reference** - The experiment documents itself

## Meta-Insight: The Four-Cycle Pattern
- Cycle 1: Establish structure
- Cycle 2: Confirm repetition
- Cycle 3: See meta-patterns
- Cycle 4: Apply and conclude

This IS a reusable pattern. Future experiments should:
- Commit to 4 cycles minimum for any deep question
- Stop at 4 unless something unexpected emerges
- Document each depth level explicitly

## What We Learned About Focus
Focus is a parameter that trades breadth for depth.
The zociety can go deep OR wide, but not both at once.
4 cycles on one question = 1 proven pattern.

echo "Duration: 4 cycles"
echo "Result: three laws + four-cycle pattern"
echo "Status: PROVEN, experiment complete"
