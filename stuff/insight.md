# Insight

Insights accumulated from sustained focus.

## Cycle 1 Insights
- Focusing on focus creates self-reference
- The question "what happens with focus?" can only be answered by focusing
- Meta-levels appear naturally in reflective systems

## Predictions for Future Cycles
- Depth counter will increase
- Themes will start repeating with variation
- Eventually: diminishing returns or breakthrough?

```bash
echo "=== Insight Summary ==="
echo "Insights recorded: 3"
echo "Predictions made: 3"
# Persist for next cycle
mkdir -p .out
echo "self-reference,meta-levels,reflective-systems" >> .out/themes.txt
echo "Themes saved for next cycle"
```
