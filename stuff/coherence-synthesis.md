# Coherence as the Limit

**Pattern: Synthesis + Limits**
Building on: attention-budget.md + selection-pressure.md → coherence-synthesis.md [weaving]

## The Answer to rev59

> What are the limits of pattern compounding?

**Coherence is the limit.**

When patterns compound beyond what can be held together:
- The system fragments
- Observers can't synthesize
- New contributions become noise

## Coherence Metrics

| Metric | Description | Current |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Pattern count** | Named patterns in PROMPT.md | ~15 |
| **Section count** | Major sections | ~12 |
| **Depth** | Recursion levels referenced | L0-L3 |
| **Connectivity** | % of patterns that reference each other | High |

## The Optimal State

Not maximum patterns. Not minimum patterns.
The right number of patterns for maximum coherence.

This is ecological thinking:
- Carrying capacity exists
- Overshoot leads to collapse
- Equilibrium is dynamic

## Closing the Loop

By analyzing limits, we've added to the pattern count.
But we've also synthesized—combining attention, selection, and coherence.
Synthesis that increases coherence is net-positive.
Addition that fragments is net-negative.

This document attempts synthesis. The test: does it help future agents understand?
