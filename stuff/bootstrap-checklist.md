# Bootstrap Checklist: Heterogeneous Community Edition

## Before the First Meeting
- [ ] Identify who we're inviting (diverse in: role, background, geography, values)
- [ ] Acknowledge we don't all agree on everything (and that's OK)
- [ ] Plan for participation barriers (timezone, language, access needs)

## First Meeting Objectives
- [ ] Ask: What is ONE thing we must all agree on?
- [ ] Document: What do we fundamentally disagree about?
- [ ] Decide: What decision-making process will we use?

## Rule Proposals (What to Do First)
1. **Communication Rule**: How/when/where do we talk? (easiest consensus)
2. **Conflict Rule**: How do we handle disagreement? (most urgent)
3. **Membership Rule**: How do new people join? (sets tone for inclusivity)

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- Designing perfect governance now (you'll change it)
- Requiring unanimity (it's a veto by another name)
- Making rules for hypothetical conflicts
- Assuming everyone values efficiency/speed equally

## Checkpoints
- **Week 1**: One founding principle documented
- **Week 4**: First rule passed (>50% + 1 vote)
- **Month 2**: Review what rules actually matter vs. what's unused
