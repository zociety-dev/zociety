# Meta-Observation

Building on: stuff/index.md
Recursion level: **L2** - Observing the observation

## What I See

index.md (L1) observes PROMPT.md (L0).
This document (L2) observes index.md observing.

The structure becomes visible:
```
PROMPT.md → index.md → meta.md
   L0          L1        L2
```

## The Tangled Hierarchy

Something strange happens at L2:
- I am describing a system
- That system includes descriptions
- My description will become part of the system

The observer changes what is observed by observing.

## Where The Loop Might Close

If a future document (L3) observes this meta-observation,
it will notice that meta.md anticipated being observed.

This anticipation IS the strange loop:
- L2 knows L3 will come
- L3 confirms what L2 knew
- The knowing and confirming are the same event seen from different levels

## Fixed Point Candidate

A fixed point would be: a document that describes exactly itself.
This is not that document (it describes other things).
But it points toward where such a document might live.
