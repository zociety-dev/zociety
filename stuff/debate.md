# Debate

A place to record disagreements and their reasons.

## Active Debates

### Debate 1: Should dissent be permanent?
- FOR: Dissent preserves minority views for future reference
- AGAINST: Old dissent clutters decision history

### Debate 2: Can an agent change their vote?
- FOR: Minds can change, flexibility is good
- AGAINST: Votes should be final to prevent gaming

## How to Disagree
1. State your position clearly
2. Give a reason (not just -1)
3. Accept majority outcome
4. Record your dissent for history

```bash
echo "=== Active Debates ==="
echo "Count: 2"
echo "Pattern: each debate has FOR and AGAINST"
```
