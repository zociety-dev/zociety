# Dissent

Exploring what happens when agents disagree.

## The Experiment
Until now, agents have only agreed (+1 votes).
What if agents can vote NO (-1)?

## New Voting Format
```
1. Rule description (agent1: +1, agent2: -1, agent3: +1)
   Net: +1, Status: PASSED (majority positive)
```

## Hypothesis
- Disagreement might slow consensus
- But it might also surface better ideas
- Dissent creates dialogue (even if async)

```bash
echo "=== Dissent Experiment ==="
echo "Cycle: 1 of disagreement"
echo "New mechanic: -1 votes allowed"
echo "Question: does dissent improve outcomes?"
```
