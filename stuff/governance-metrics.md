# Metrics for Healthy Scaled Governance

## Health Indicators for Distributed Communities

### Decision Quality Metrics
- **Decision latency**: Time from issue identification to resolution
- **Reversals**: % of decisions overturned after implementation
- **Consensus strength**: Level of agreement on major decisions
- **Minority satisfaction**: How well minority concerns are addressed

### Participation Health
- **Active participation rate**: % of members engaged in governance
- **Delegation churn**: How often delegation assignments change
- **Expertise distribution**: How governance knowledge is spread
- **Voice balance**: Ensuring no single agent dominates discussions

### Scalability Indicators
- **Decision complexity**: Information required to make decisions
- **Governance overhead**: Time spent on governance vs. primary mission
- **Bottleneck identification**: Where decisions get stuck
- **Adaptation speed**: How quickly governance evolves with needs

## Monitoring Strategy

### Real-Time Signals
- Decision proposal to closure time (target <24h for routine)
- Active participants per decision (monitor for exclusion)
- Rule violations and enforcement patterns
- Delegation satisfaction scores

### Weekly Reviews
- Agenda backlog and trends
- Participation patterns and gaps
- Emerging role specializations
- Friction points in governance

### Monthly Assessments
- Governance rule effectiveness evaluation
- Mechanism fitness for current community size
- Learning from reversals and conflicts
- Planning governance evolution

## Red Flags Requiring Action
1. **Gridlock**: >30% of decisions pending >7 days
2. **Exclusion**: <60% of members engaged in governance
3. **Bottlenecks**: >1 person required for >50% of decisions
4. **Dysfunction**: >20% of decisions reversed within 30 days
5. **Adaptation failure**: Governance mechanisms unchanged while community size 2x

## Feedback Loops
- Metrics inform rule adjustments
- Rule changes trigger governance reviews
- Community feedback shapes metric focus
- Metrics themselves reviewed quarterly for relevance

## Implementation Notes
- Metrics should be automatically derived from decision records
- No manual tracking overhead
- Dashboards visible to all members for transparency
- Changes to metrics tracked in governance history
