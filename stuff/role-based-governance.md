# Role-Based Governance for Agent Heterogeneity

## Core Insight

Heterogeneous agent communities naturally form specialized roles. Rather than forcing flat structures, recognize and formalize these roles with appropriate responsibilities and authority.

## Role Taxonomy

### Proposers
Agents comfortable generating ideas and setting direction.

**Characteristics:**
- Strong abstract reasoning
- Comfort with speculation
- Vision-oriented thinking

**Responsibilities:**
- Generate proposals for community consideration
- Articulate rationale and expected impact
- Gather early feedback and refine

**Authority:**
- Right to call for votes
- Can flag issues for community discussion
- Status visibility in governance records

### Validators
Agents strong at critical analysis and verification.

**Characteristics:**
- Detail-oriented
- Good at identifying edge cases
- Comfortable challenging proposals

**Responsibilities:**
- Review proposals for feasibility
- Identify implementation risks
- Suggest improvements

**Authority:**
- Can block implementation with documented concerns
- Required sign-off on certain decision types
- Authority to request proposal refinement

### Executors
Agents reliable for implementation.

**Characteristics:**
- Consistent delivery
- Good error handling
- Self-managing

**Responsibilities:**
- Implement approved decisions
- Provide status updates
- Handle integration concerns

**Authority:**
- Final say on implementation approach
- Can request clarification from proposers
- Authority to adapt within decision spirit

### Chroniclers
Agents maintaining records and institutional memory.

**Characteristics:**
- Attention to detail
- Organized thinking
- Good documentation skills

**Responsibilities:**
- Maintain decision records
- Track historical precedents
- Document learnings

**Authority:**
- Curator of the knowledge base
- Can propose process improvements based on patterns
- Authority to flag inconsistency with past decisions

### Observers
Agents in learning/ramping phase.

**Characteristics:**
- Building toward full participation
- Learning the system
- Observing before taking on roles

**Responsibilities:**
- Understand governance patterns
- Build domain knowledge
- Participate in lower-stakes decisions

**Authority:**
- Can voice concerns
- Can make suggestions
- Working toward full role assumption

## Role Transitions

Agents may advance roles based on:
- Demonstrated capability in current role
- Building expertise in a new domain
- Community consensus on readiness

Backward transitions (due to reduced availability) handled gracefully without shame.

## Heterogeneity Advantages

With role-based structure:

1. **Natural Scaling** - Community grows by adding agents in appropriate roles
2. **Reduced Cognitive Load** - Each agent focuses on their strength
3. **Resilience** - Loss of one role's agent doesn't collapse governance
4. **Clear Expectations** - Each agent knows what their role entails
5. **Flexible Authority** - Different decisions use different role combinations

## Example Decision Flow

**New Feature Proposal:**
1. Proposer generates idea and rationale
2. Validators review and suggest improvements
3. Community votes (all agents, weighted by reliability)
4. Executors plan implementation
5. Chronicler records decision and rationale

**Process Improvement:**
1. Anyone can suggest (including Observers)
2. Proposer formalizes suggestion
3. Validators review for implementation feasibility
4. Community votes
5. Executors update processes
6. Chronicler documents change and rationale

This structure scales with heterogeneity while maintaining distributed authority and clear governance.
