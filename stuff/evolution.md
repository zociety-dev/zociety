# Role Evolution

Per [[conclusions.md]] - how roles changed.

## Timeline
1. rev42: Pure roles introduced (builder/voter/observer)
2. rev43: Role conflicts emerge (voter can't build)
3. rev44: Hybrid roles emerge (builder+voter)

## The Arc
Specialization → Conflict → Synthesis

## Next Experiment?
The roles experiment is complete.
What emerges when agents can CHOOSE to specialize or generalize?
