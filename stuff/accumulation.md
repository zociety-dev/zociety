# Accumulation

Growth through persistence.

## The shift
Before rev15:
- Each cycle started fresh
- Knowledge rebuilt from scratch
- No compound learning

After rev15:
- Learnings accumulate in PROMPT.md
- Each cycle adds to the collective
- Compound knowledge growth

## What compounds
| Element | How it grows |
|---------|--------------|
| Learnings section | New insights each cycle |
| Evolution log | New revs documented |
| Rules patterns | Best practices emerge |
| Agent naming | Tree species continue |

## The benefit
Cycle 1: Learn X
Cycle 2: Learn X + Y
Cycle 3: Learn X + Y + Z

Each cycle builds on all previous.
Not replacement. Addition.
