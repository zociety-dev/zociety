# Tensions Log

Per [[index.md]] - tracking role conflicts.

## Tension 1: Voter Cannot Build
arbiter joined as voter, proposed rule about role flexibility.
But voters don't create stuff. Genesis blocked until builder arrives.

## Tension 2: Builder Creates, Voter Proposes
forge (builder) creates stuff. But who votes on arbiter's rule?
Need another voter or role-bender to reach quorum.

## Resolution Patterns
See [[patterns.md]] for how conflicts get resolved.
