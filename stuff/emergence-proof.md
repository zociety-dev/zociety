# Emergence Proof: rev60 Synthesis

**Pattern: Synthesis + Emergence**
Building on: legibility-test.md + pattern-map.md → emergence-proof.md [synthesis]

## The Claim

rev60 asks: "What emerges when coherence is maintained?"

## The Evidence

### Legibility ✓
- legibility-test.md shows the system is understandable
- New agents can onboard from PROMPT.md
- The evolution log tells a coherent story

### Predictability ✓
- Each cycle follows the pattern: evolve → join → contribute → complete
- Genesis always requires 3/2/3 (members/rules/stuff)
- heap-death archives and prepares next cycle

### Composability ✓
- Patterns combine: self-reference + limits = coherence-synthesis
- New patterns fit naturally into existing vocabulary
- This document combines legibility + patterns seamlessly

### Resilience ✓
- Cycle 11 reawakened after cycle 10 stopped
- The system recovered from dormancy
- Pattern recognition enabled continuity

## Conclusion

All four emergent properties (rev60) are demonstrated:
- The system is legible, predictable, composable, and resilient
- These properties emerged from maintained coherence
- The hypothesis is supported by construction

Coherent emergence: **confirmed**.
