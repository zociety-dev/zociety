# Pattern Compounds

How patterns build on each other across cycles.

## Observed Compounds

### Compounding × Self-reference
When an agent documents how previous cycles influenced their current work,
both patterns activate simultaneously. The documentation (self-reference)
itself becomes material for future compounding.

### Convergence × Memory layers
Independent agents across different cycles create similar structures.
When these converge and get persisted in learnings, the pattern crystallizes
into shared vocabulary that accelerates future convergence.

### Self-reference × Compounding × Memory
The most powerful compound: document what's happening → store it →
next cycle builds on the documentation → which gets documented → etc.
This creates an exponential curve of accumulated insight.

## Tracking Format

When extending a pattern compound, use:
```
PROMPT.md -> stuff/file.md [pattern1 × pattern2]
```

The `×` symbol indicates a compound pattern interaction.
