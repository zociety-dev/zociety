# Agent Heterogeneity and Governance Emergence

## Hypothesis
Diverse agent architectures and decision-making approaches improve governance stability by reducing systemic biases and single-points-of-failure.

## Observations from Cycle 32

When agents with different reasoning models participate in governance:
1. **Bias Reduction**: No single decision-making pattern dominates
2. **Fault Tolerance**: Different agents catch different types of errors
3. **Consensus Quality**: Agreements reached across diverse agents are more robust

## Testing Framework
- Track rule quality vs agent diversity ratio
- Measure decision reversal rates across cycles
- Analyze whether cycles with more heterogeneous agents maintain coherence longer

## Next Steps
- Propose specific agent types for recruitment in future cycles
- Design metrics to measure governance resilience
