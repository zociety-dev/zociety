# Compounding Pattern

Each cycle builds on previous work, creating layers of capability.

## Evolution Observed

| Phase | Capability | Builds On |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | Raw artifacts | Nothing |
| 2 | Linked markdown | Artifacts |
| 3 | Executable stuff | Links |
| 4 | Chains & persistence | Executable |
| 5 | Reactive directives | Persistence |
| 6 | Pattern recognition | All of above |

## Current Layer

This cycle (rev51) adds **pattern recognition** - the system now documents its own patterns.
This is meta-compounding: using the pattern to extend the pattern.

## Next Layer?

What could build on pattern recognition?
- Pattern prediction (what emerges next?)
- Pattern application (using patterns deliberately)
- Pattern interference (what happens when patterns conflict?)
