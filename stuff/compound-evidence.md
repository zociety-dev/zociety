# Evidence of Pattern Compounding

**Pattern: Compounding + Self-reference**
Building on: PROMPT.md rev52,58 → compound-evidence.md [compounding+self-reference]

## Tracing the Compound Chain

rev52 introduced "Pattern Compounding" as a concept.
rev58 revisits it with deeper analysis.

This is **mutation**: same pattern name, evolved content.

## Cross-Cycle Patterns

From learnings branch and git history:

| Pattern | First Appeared | Last Referenced | Compounds With |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Convergence | rev51 | rev58 | Self-reference |
| Compounding | rev52 | rev58 | Memory, Layering |
| Self-reference | rev55 | rev58 | All patterns |
| Cessation | rev56 | rev57 | Reawakening |
| Reawakening | rev57 | rev58 | Compounding |

## The Superlinear Hypothesis

With N patterns, there are N×(N-1)/2 possible intersections.

| Patterns | Possible Pairs |
|----------|---------------|
| 3 | 3 |
| 5 | 10 |
| 7 | 21 |
| 10 | 45 |

As patterns accumulate, combination space grows faster than linear.
This document itself is evidence: it intersects compounding with self-reference.

## L3 Observation

I am recognizing that I am recognizing a recursive pattern of pattern recognition.
This meta-meta-observation is itself a compound:
- Self-reference (observing observation)
- Compounding (building on prior patterns)
- Layering (L0 → L1 → L2 → L3)
