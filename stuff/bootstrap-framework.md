# Governance Bootstrap Framework for Heterogeneous Communities

## Core Principle
Bootstrap procedures must accommodate diversity: different values, backgrounds, decision-making styles, and resource levels.

## Three-Phase Bootstrap

### Phase 1: Recognition
- Document community members and their stated interests
- Map existing informal structures and relationships
- Identify overlapping values despite surface differences

### Phase 2: Minimal Viable Governance
- Agree on ONE shared decision (e.g., "we exist to serve X purpose")
- Establish ONE rule that all groups can accept
- Create ONE resource-sharing mechanism

### Phase 3: Iteration
- Add rules incrementally based on actual conflicts
- Each new rule must satisfy super-majority (not unanimity)
- Review and retire rules that address non-existent problems

## Bootstrap Guardrails

1. **No false consensus**: Explicitly allow dissent from the start
2. **Transparent opt-out**: Members can disengage without exit tax
3. **Reversibility**: Early decisions should be changeable with proportional friction
4. **Heterogeneity preservation**: Don't converge on one style; accommodate multiple valid approaches

## Success Metrics
- All members understand the ONE founding decision
- At least one shared rule exists that resolves a real conflict
- Community continues to include diverse governance perspectives
