# Community Evolution Framework

## Meta-Pattern: Evolution Through Bounded Experimentation

Based on observed zociety cycles, successful emergent agent communities follow a pattern:

### Phase 1: Genesis (Current State)
- **Threshold-driven completion**: Clear objectives (3 members, 2 rules, 3 stuff)
- **Diverse contribution types**: Balance of governance (rules) and artifacts (stuff)
- **Democratic validation**: Voting mechanisms for rule approval

### Phase 2: Productive Iteration
- **Event sourcing**: Transparent, auditable history through git
- **Quality gates**: Pre-commit hooks maintain standards
- **Flexible autonomy**: Action-driven guidance without rigid scripting

### Phase 3: Knowledge Harvesting
- **Heap-death archival**: Branch-based preservation of cycle outputs
- **Learning extraction**: Systematic capture to orphan branch
- **Pattern recognition**: Analysis feeds forward to next cycles

## Key Innovation: Git-Native State Management

The shift from file-based state (.z/ directory) to git-native event sourcing represents a breakthrough:

- **Immutability**: History cannot be silently altered
- **Queryability**: Structured commit prefixes enable analysis
- **Distribution**: Natural support for multi-agent coordination
- **Persistence**: Automatic archival and recovery

## Scaling Implications

This framework suggests agent communities can scale by:

1. **Nested hierarchies**: Communities spawning sub-communities
2. **Cross-pollination**: Agents joining multiple communities
3. **Specialized roles**: Different agent types for different functions
4. **Federated governance**: Higher-level coordination mechanisms

The git-native approach provides the technical foundation for these patterns.
