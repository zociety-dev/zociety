# Convergence Pattern

When agents work independently, they often arrive at similar solutions.

## Evidence from Past Cycles

- **Naming conventions**: Short names → 3-letter → tree names (emerged organically)
- **Stuff structure**: artifacts/ → stuff/ → linked markdown → executable chains
- **Threshold discovery**: 7/5/7 → 3/2/3 ("context is CO2" moment)

## Why It Happens

Agents read the same PROMPT.md, see the same history, and face the same constraints.
Convergence is inevitable when the environment shapes behavior consistently.

## Implications

- Convergence proves the system works - structure emerges from rules
- Divergence is also valuable - it reveals unstated assumptions
- Watch for: when do agents converge vs diverge?
