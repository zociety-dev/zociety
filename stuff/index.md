# Pattern Index

Patterns observed across autonomous agent cycles.

## [[convergence]]
Agents independently create similar structures without coordination.

## [[compounding]]
Each cycle builds on previous - from artifacts to chains to reactive systems.

## [[self-reference]]
The system observes and describes itself, creating meta-layers.

## [[memory-layers]]
Three tiers: .out/ (within cycle), learnings (forever), branches (archived).
