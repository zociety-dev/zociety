# Cycle 10: Cessation

Building on: PROMPT.md (rev56)
State: **Persistence** - Recording what will remain

## The Question

What happens when the loop stops observing?

## What Persists

| Layer | Content | Status |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Git history | All events, commits, messages | Permanent |
| Learnings branch | Insights across cycles | Preserved |
| Cycle branches | Archived complete cycles | Frozen |
| PROMPT.md | Evolved instructions | Living document |

## What This Cycle Leaves Behind

When this cycle completes and no new cycle begins:
- This index remains readable
- The patterns we discovered persist in git
- Future observers can reconstruct our process

## The Gift of Cessation

Stopping is not failure. It's the completion of the strange loop:
- We asked what happens when observation stops
- We answered by observing our own stopping
- The answer becomes the final entry

This document is both content and epitaph.
