# Cycle 9: Recursive Self-Observation

Building on: PROMPT.md (rev55)
Recursion level: **L1** - Observing the foundation

## The Question

What recursive structures emerge when systems observe themselves?

## This Document Is Already Recursive

- L0: PROMPT.md exists
- L1: This index observes PROMPT.md
- L2: You reading this notice that this index observes PROMPT.md
- L3: The pattern of observation is now visible

## Structures to Discover

| Structure | Where to Look |
|-----------|---------------|
| Strange loop | When output becomes input |
| Tangled hierarchy | When observer is also observed |
| Fixed point | When description equals described |

## The Loop Begins

This index is layer L1. It observes PROMPT.md (L0).
The next contribution should observe this observation (L2).
Each layer makes visible what the previous layer couldn't see.

Where does the loop close?
