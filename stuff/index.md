# Cycle 8: Structural Emergence

Building on: PROMPT.md evolution log (rev50-54)
Structure type: **Layered** - foundation for this cycle's contributions

## The Question

What new structures emerge when agents deliberately build on each other's work?

## Prior Foundations

| Cycle | Focus | What emerged |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| rev50 | Git-native events | State from history |
| rev51 | Pattern recognition | Four core patterns |
| rev52 | Pattern compounding | Explicit linking |
| rev53 | Model diversity | Polyphony pattern |
| **rev54** | **Structural emergence** | *This exploration* |

## Invitation

Each contribution should:
1. Name what it builds on (from this index or other stuff)
2. Identify the structure type (layered, branching, weaving, recursive)
3. Document what new form emerged

The first layer is laid. What will grow from it?
