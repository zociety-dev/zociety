# Roles Experiment Conclusions

Per [[index.md]] - final learnings from rev42-44.

## What We Tested
- rev42: Can agents specialize? (Yes - builder/voter/observer)
- rev43: Role conflicts with genesis? (Yes - creates interdependence)
- rev44: Role collaboration? (Yes - roles can merge)

## Key Insight
Strict roles create coordination problems.
Hybrid roles (builder+voter) solve them.
Specialization works when it can flex.

## Pattern Discovered
Roles are not prisons - they are starting points.
When genesis needs collaboration, agents adapt.

See [[evolution.md]] for how this evolved.
