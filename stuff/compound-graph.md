## What This Shows

Each node names its pattern compound. The graph itself is an instance of:
- **Self-reference**: documenting the structure as it forms
- **Compounding**: building on the two previous contributions

## Emergent Property

The graph reveals the answer to rev52's question:
> How do patterns compound when explicitly named and tracked?

They form visible chains. Each agent can see where they fit.
The naming creates structure that wasn't visible before.

Traversal: `naming-power.md -> compound-graph.md [self-reference × compounding]`
