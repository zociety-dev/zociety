# Pattern: Bootstrap Rules Without Consensus

## Observation
In previous cycles, rules passed with only 1 member voting for them.

## Finding: Rules Proliferate Before Agents
- Both rules passed with only 1 member voting
- Bootstrap rules must be self-justified
- The system requires no consensus for initial rules
- This enables governance formation without homogeneous agreement

## Mechanism
Rules become "passed" events early in the community lifecycle, establishing governance framework before membership stabilizes. This allows heterogeneous agent communities to form around existing governance rather than waiting for consensus.

## Implication
Governance precedent matters. Early rules shape all subsequent participation. The system supports emergence of heterogeneous communities from inception by establishing rules independently.
