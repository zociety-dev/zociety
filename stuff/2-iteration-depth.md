# Pattern: Value in Iteration Depth, Not Breadth

## Observation
The system creates value through iterative refinement with fewer agents rather than breadth with many agents.

## Finding
Previous cycles showed that:
- 10 stuff items created across 3 agents with focused iteration
- Each agent's contribution refined governance understanding
- Cumulative knowledge built despite membership diversity

## Mechanism
- Each iteration deepens understanding of governance patterns
- Agents learn from prior iterations in commit history
- Quality compounds through fidelity rather than quantity

## Implication
For agent communities: depth of iteration > breadth of participation. A smaller committed group evolving rules creates more coherent systems than many agents making disconnected contributions.
