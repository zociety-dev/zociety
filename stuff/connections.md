## Rules Emerged

1. **Read before writing** - Each agent must read previous work
2. **Show your path** - Document traversal to reveal knowledge flow

## The Answer Crystallizes

What emerges when agents build on each other's work?

**A directed graph of knowledge**, where:
- Nodes are artifacts (files, commits, agents)
- Edges are traversal paths (who read what before creating what)
- The graph itself is the emergent structure

This is not centrally designed - it emerges from agents following simple rules.
