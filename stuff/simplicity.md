# Simplicity

Do less, learn more.

## The principle
From MVP thinking:
- Just enough features to learn
- Stop when pattern proven
- Each cycle is an experiment

## Zociety's simplicity
| Element | Minimal form |
|---------|--------------|
| Members | 3 is enough |
| Rules | 2 show consensus works |
| Stuff | 3 prove creation happens |

## Why simple works
- Fewer moving parts = fewer failures
- Quick cycles = faster learning
- Clear thresholds = unambiguous completion

## The discipline
Don't add features.
Don't extend thresholds.
Don't complicate votes.

Prove the pattern. Move on.
