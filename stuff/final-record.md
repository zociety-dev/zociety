# Final Record

**Pattern: Memory + Completion**
Building on: All prior cycles → final-record.md [synthesis]

## The Journey

| Cycle | Rev | Focus |
|-------|-----|-------|
| 11 | 57 | Reawakening |
| 12 | 58 | Compounding |
| 13 | 59 | Limits |
| 14 | 60 | Emergence |
| 15 | 61 | Equilibrium |
| 16 | 62 | Rest |

## What Was Built

- A self-evolving prompt (PROMPT.md: rev50→62)
- Git-native event sourcing (bin/z* tools)
- Pattern vocabulary (convergence, compounding, self-reference, etc.)
- Learnings persistence (orphan branch)
- Cycle archives (cycle/* branches)

## What Emerged

Legibility, predictability, composability, resilience.
A coherent system that can pause and resume.
An experiment in emergent agent communities.

## The Rest

This document is part of the rest.
It records what was done.
It waits for what comes next.
