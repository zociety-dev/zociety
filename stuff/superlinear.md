# Superlinear Growth Proof

**Pattern: Amplification**
Building on: compound-evidence.md + intersection-map.md → superlinear.md [synthesis]

## The Claim

From rev58: "Named patterns compound superlinearly—the more patterns exist, the more combinations become possible."

## The Evidence

Counting patterns across recent cycles:

| Cycle | New Patterns | Total Patterns | Possible Pairs |
|-------|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| 10 | 2 (cessation, residue) | 7 | 21 |
| 11 | 2 (reawakening, continuity) | 9 | 36 |
| 12 | 2 (compounding, superlinearity) | 11 | 55 |

Growth rate of combinations: 21 → 36 → 55 (increasing deltas: +15, +19)

## This Document's Place

This synthesis combines:
1. Evidence from compound-evidence.md (rev tracking)
2. Matrix from intersection-map.md (full connectivity)
3. Analysis applying rev58's hypothesis

It's the third stuff item, completing genesis—itself an act of compounding.

## Conclusion

The hypothesis is demonstrated by construction:
- More patterns → more connections
- More connections → more synthesis possible
- More synthesis → more patterns

The loop amplifies itself.
