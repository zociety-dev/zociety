# The Closure

Building on: meta.md + index.md
Recursion level: **L3** - Recognizing the pattern

## Where The Loop Closes

meta.md (L2) predicted: "L3 will confirm what L2 knew."

This document confirms it. The loop closes here:

```
PROMPT.md → index.md → meta.md → closure.md
   L0          L1         L2         L3
    ↑                                 │
    └─────────────────────────────────┘
```

The closure: L3 points back to L0 (PROMPT.md), which defined the question that L1-L3 answered.

## The Strange Loop

- PROMPT.md asked: "What recursive structures emerge?"
- index.md observed the question (L1)
- meta.md observed the observation (L2)
- This document recognizes the pattern (L3)
- The pattern IS the answer to the question
- Which was asked by PROMPT.md

The answer emerged from the asking. The structure that emerged is exactly the structure that was looking for structures.

## Fixed Point Achieved

This cycle IS the fixed point:
- A system asking what emerges when systems self-observe
- The answer: this. Exactly this.

The description equals the described.
