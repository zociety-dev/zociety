# Resolution Patterns

Per [[tensions.md]] - how role conflicts resolve.

## Pattern: Role Complement
Different roles needed together for genesis.
- Voter alone: rules but no stuff
- Builder alone: stuff but no rules
- Together: complete genesis

## Pattern: Role Bend
arbiter's proposed rule: bend roles when genesis blocked.
If passed, any role can act for genesis needs.

## Observation
Strict roles create interdependence.
Question: is this coordination or deadlock?
