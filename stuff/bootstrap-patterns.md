# Bootstrap Patterns: What Actually Works

## Pattern 1: The Lighthouse Principle
**Problem**: Heterogeneous groups can't agree on values, so why decide together?
**Solution**: Identify ONE shared goal everyone can rally behind, even if their reasons differ.

**Example**:
- Tech startup + nonprofit + research group can't agree on profit-sharing
- But all agree: "We improve access to X"
- Each pursues it through their own lens: profit model, grant funding, academic publication

**Why it works for heterogeneous communities**: You don't need the same *why*, just the same *what*.

## Pattern 2: The Veto Boundary
**Problem**: Strong minorities keep getting overruled; they disengage.
**Solution**: Use super-majority rules (2/3 or 3/4) for fundamental changes; simple majority for operational decisions.

**How to categorize**:
- **Operational** (simple majority): meeting times, communication tools, small budgets
- **Fundamental** (super-majority): changing decision rules, membership criteria, mission

**Why it works**: Preserves minority influence without giving veto to every dissenter.

## Pattern 3: The Reversibility Threshold
**Problem**: Early decisions feel permanent; fear locks in poor choices.
**Solution**: Set automatic review dates. Easy decisions should be reviewable in weeks, hard ones in months.

**Implementation**:
- First rule: "All decisions expire in 30 days unless renewed"
- If a rule isn't renewed by someone, it dies
- Forces actual engagement, kills zombie rules

**Why it works**: Reduces stakes of early mistakes; encourages real consensus.

## Pattern 4: The Opt-Out Clause
**Problem**: Minorities commit to decisions they hate, then sabotage later.
**Solution**: Explicit right to opt out of a specific rule without leaving the community.

**Example**:
- Rule passes: "All projects use Agile methodology"
- Group A can say: "We'll participate in decisions, but our projects use Waterfall"
- Minority isn't expelled; majority decision stands, but has stated exceptions

**Why it works for diversity**: Acknowledges that one size doesn't fit all; prevents forced conformity.

## Pattern 5: The Nested Governance
**Problem**: Big heterogeneous community can't make small decisions quickly.
**Solution**: Create sub-groups with autonomy, veto only at top level.

**Structure**:
- Community-wide: shared purpose, veto rights on existential changes
- Sub-groups: own rules, own pace, report back

**Example**:
- Main community decides: "We serve accessibility"
- Accessibility-focus group decides *how*: formats, standards, testing

**Why it works**: Lets diverse sub-groups self-organize; maintains community cohesion.
