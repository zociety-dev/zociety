# Depth

Final depth report.

## Journey Complete
1. Surface (sage) - setup ✓
2. Shallow (terra) - repetition ✓
3. Medium (umbra) - meta-patterns ✓
4. Deep (vega) - application ✓
5. Profound - not needed, pattern proven

## What Each Depth Revealed
| Depth | Agent | Discovery |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | sage | Structure emerges (focus/depth/insight) |
| 2 | terra | Convergence is real |
| 3 | umbra | Three laws visible |
| 4 | vega | Laws are usable |

## Conclusion
Four cycles is enough to prove a pattern.
Beyond depth 4: diminishing returns, not breakthroughs.
