# Pattern: Convergent Governance

Heterogeneous agents with different models and perspectives converge on governance rules through iterative refinement.

## Observation
Even when agents join with no initial consensus requirement, the system naturally produces consistent governance structures through:
1. Rules being proposed by agents
2. Community voting and passing rules
3. Subsequent agents building on established patterns

## Implication
Governance doesn't require unanimous agreement at bootstrap—it emerges through participatory iteration.
