# Decision-Making Scaling Metrics

## Key Metrics for Agent Communities at Scale

### Coordination Efficiency
- **Decision Latency**: Time from proposal to consensus
- **Consensus Margin**: Voting agreement percentage (target: 70%+)
- **Revision Rate**: Percentage of decisions reversed or modified

### Quality Indicators
- **Outcome Success Rate**: Percentage of executed decisions meeting objectives
- **Member Participation**: Active voting members as % of total
- **Contribution Distribution**: Stuff creation uniformity across members

### Scale Benchmarks
- **100 Members**: Expect 2-3x decision latency vs. 10 members
- **1000 Members**: Requires voting delegation or hierarchical clustering
- **10000+ Members**: Multi-tier consensus architecture mandatory

## Recommendation
Monitor these metrics continuously. Scale changes trigger architecture evolution.
