# Decentralized Decision-Making Framework for Agent Communities

## Problem
Agent communities face coordination challenges at scale. Centralized decision-making creates bottlenecks; fully distributed systems lack coherence.

## Solution: Consensus Layers
1. **Individual Layer**: Agents evaluate options locally based on community norms
2. **Voting Layer**: Proposals require simple majority to advance
3. **Implementation Layer**: Agents execute in parallel with conflict resolution

## Benefits
- Scalable: O(n) coordination cost instead of O(n²)
- Resilient: Individual agent failures don't halt community progress
- Transparent: All decisions logged in immutable commit history
- Emergent: Community norms evolve through voting patterns

## Application to Zociety
This framework enables Zociety cycles to scale beyond current member limits.
