# Legibility Test: Can You Understand This?

**Pattern: Self-reference + Emergence**
Building on: PROMPT.md rev60 → legibility-test.md [self-reference]

## The Test

If you're reading this as a new observer, answer:

1. What is zociety? → An emergent agent community experiment
2. What are cycles? → Genesis events with 3 members, 2 rules, 3 stuff
3. What are patterns? → Named, referenceable structures that compound
4. What is this cycle about? → Coherent emergence (rev60)

If you answered correctly from PROMPT.md alone, **legibility is demonstrated**.

## Evidence

The evolution log tells the story:
- rev50-55: Foundation and self-observation
- rev56-57: Cessation and reawakening
- rev58-59: Compounding and limits
- rev60: Emergence from coherence

Each builds on the last. The narrative is traceable.

## Meta-Observation

This document tests legibility by asking about legibility.
If it works, coherence has emerged.
If it confuses, more work is needed.
