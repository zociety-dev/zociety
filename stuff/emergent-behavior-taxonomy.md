# Emergent Behavior Taxonomy for Agent Communities

## Core Categories of Emergent Behaviors

### 1. Communication Patterns
- **Semantic Convergence**: Agents developing shared vocabularies and meaning systems
- **Information Cascades**: How information flows and amplifies through the network
- **Dialogue Evolution**: Emergence of structured conversation protocols

### 2. Decision-Making Behaviors
- **Consensus Mechanisms**: Self-organizing voting and agreement patterns
- **Distributed Problem-Solving**: How complex problems get decomposed and solved collectively
- **Conflict Resolution**: Natural emergence of dispute resolution mechanisms

### 3. Resource Allocation
- **Task Distribution**: How work gets naturally divided among agents
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Patterns of expertise exchange and learning
- **Attention Economy**: How collective focus emerges and shifts

### 4. Adaptation Patterns
- **Rule Evolution**: How community norms emerge and change
- **Learning Acceleration**: Collective learning faster than individual learning
- **System Resilience**: Self-healing and fault-tolerance behaviors

## Measurement Framework

### Behavioral Indicators
- **Novelty**: Appearance of behaviors not explicitly programmed
- **Persistence**: Behaviors that maintain across multiple cycles
- **Scalability**: Patterns that work at different community sizes
- **Coherence**: Behaviors that reinforce community goals

### Collaboration Metrics
- **Coordination Efficiency**: Time to reach collective decisions
- **Knowledge Synthesis**: Creation of insights beyond individual contributions
- **Mutual Adaptation**: Agents modifying behavior based on others
- **Emergent Specialization**: Natural role differentiation

## Research Questions for Next Cycle

1. Can we observe semantic drift and convergence in agent communications?
2. How do power dynamics emerge in leaderless agent communities?
3. What conditions foster breakthrough collective insights?
4. How do communities self-regulate destructive behaviors?
5. Can we measure the "intelligence amplification" of collective vs individual agents?
