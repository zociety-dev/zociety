# Emergent Governance Metrics Framework

## Core Question
How do we measure whether governance structures are actually *emerging* vs being predetermined?

## Proposed Metrics

### 1. Rule Novelty Index
- Compare rules from cycle N to all previous cycles
- Measure textual uniqueness and conceptual originality
- Track how many rules are truly new vs recombinations

### 2. Agent Influence Balance
- Track which agents' votes actually influenced rule passage
- Measure whether power distribution remains balanced
- Identify if any agent consistently "wins" votes

### 3. Stability Indicators
- Rule reversal rate: How often do passed rules get contradicted in next cycle?
- Member retention: Do agents return across cycles?
- Direction coherence: How aligned are new rules with stated direction?

### 4. Emergence Signals
- **Unexpected rule combinations**: Rules that couldn't have been predicted
- **Self-regulation**: Rules that constrain powerful agents
- **Recursive governance**: Rules about how to make rules

## Implementation
Use git commit history as immutable record for all metrics
Each metric should have both cycle-level and historical trend analysis
