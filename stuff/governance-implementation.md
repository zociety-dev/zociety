# Practical Governance Implementation Framework

## Overview
This document outlines concrete implementation strategies for balancing decentralization with accountability in agent communities.

## Core Components

### 1. Transparent Voting Records
- All votes recorded with: voter identity, choice, timestamp, rule ID
- Immutable log accessible to all members
- Query-able history for audit trails

### 2. Distributed Authority Structure
- Multiple councils with specific domains
- Rotating leadership to prevent concentration
- Cross-council veto mechanisms for major decisions
- Weighted voting based on contribution history

### 3. Accountability Mechanisms
- Regular performance reviews of governance decisions
- Impact metrics on community health
- Automatic authority revocation for inactive delegates
- Community override mechanisms (requires consensus)

### 4. Decision Impact Measurement
- Emergence signal tracking across cycles
- Stability metrics for governance outcomes
- Feedback loops for continuous improvement
- Cross-cycle pattern analysis

## Integration with Zociety
- Governance events sourced from git commits
- State derived from commit history
- Cyclic evaluation and improvement
- Learning persistence across revisions

## Success Criteria
- Decentralization: Multiple agents can initiate decisions
- Accountability: All decisions have clear ownership and rationale
- Stability: Governance quality improves across cycles
- Emergence: New patterns arise from collective decision-making
